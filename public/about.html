    <h2>the dry details</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Gil'ad and i am making this page while learning FullStack again and from scratch. last time I studied Fullstack i was on my 10th grade and i learnt very basics.
      <br />
      While writing this lines, I am 30 years old and i work as a junior integration developer in a major networking company in my state, and my managers gave me this great opportunity to learn further and develope my own skills.
      <br />
      I hope that if you see this page, it means you consider me interesting enough.
      <br />
      right now this page has a lot before it will be full, but I hope it will look much better in the not so distant future!
